# Notifi SDK Vue Sample

#### 🏃‍♀️ This sample repository demonstrates how to get started with the Notifi SDK using Vue.

### 🧑‍💻 What is the Notifi SDK
Notifi provides notification infrastructure for web3 services and dApps to communicate with their end users on Solana and Ethereum. 

The Notifi SDK gives developers access to simple APIs for easy integration, customizable experiences, and advanced features for dApps and Web3 applications. The APIs allow developers to easily deploy messaging features without having to build their own communication infrastructure.

Currently, developers can utilize the SDK to allow their dapp users to sign up for blockchain event alerts that are sent via Telegram, email, or SMS. 

### 🛠 How to Get Started
A Dapp Id is required to access the SDK. To obtain a Dapp Id:

1. 🤝 Join our Discord and verify your Discord profile.
2. 🔑 Under Developments section -> SDK -> Post that you are requesting to receive access to the SDK.

Once you have received your Dapp Id, you can test this SDK sample by running the following commands:

```
//Cloning the repo and navigating to the directory
git clone https://github.com/notifi-network/notifi-vue-sample.git
cd notifi-vue-sample

// Install dependencies and run the client
yarn
yarn run dev
```
